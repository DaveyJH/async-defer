  <h1>Script Timing Test</h1>
  <p>
    This text is written in the HTML file. The order list below is empty until
    it is populated by JavaScript. Changing the defer / async methods and
    positions will cause the results to appear in different orders. There is no
    difference between the scripts.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have added some images below to add a little to the loading time of the page.
    Try performing a cache refresh a number of times and see if the order of
    the list items remains the same.

  </ol>

  <p>
    You should find that <code>async</code> scripts can appear at any time, or not at all.
    This is because the <code>ol</code> element has not always been created by the time the
    script is trying to call upon it.
  </p>
  <p>Deferred scripts will load after the DOM, as will scripts placed at the bottom
    of the <code>body</code> element. If a script at the bottom of the <code>body</code> has no
    attribute, it will load before any deferred scripts. It is more common to see
    the script placed in the <code>head</code> with <code>defer</code> in modern development.
  </p>
  <p>Combining <code>defer</code> and <code>async</code> ensures the script loads after the DOM, but will
    not maintain the order in which they load. This may be preferred in some
    situations. The order of the attributes makes no difference to the timing,
    <code>async defer</code> is the same as <code>defer async</code>.
